Here's my first post on Jekyll!

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes plain text files and converts them into a static website or blog. It's great for:

- **Speed**: Since everything is pre-rendered, pages load quickly.
- **Simplicity**: Markdown for content, Liquid for logic.
- **Flexibility**: You can use your own CSS or use themes.

### How to Write Posts

Posts in Jekyll are written in Markdown, which is easy to learn and use. Here's how you can format text:

- **Bold**: `**text**` or `__text__`
- *Italics*: `*text*` or `_text_`
- `Code`: ` `code` `
- Lists:
  - Unordered: `- item`
  - Ordered: `1. item`

I'm looking forward to writing more posts!
