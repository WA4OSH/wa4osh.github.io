# TELOS

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document captures the TELOS method of articulating a person's personal context so that they, and AI, can better understand them and help them improve. Pay attention to the items and the concepts here, and especially on how they work together.

The conceptual path is Problems -> Mission -> (Narratives) -> Goals -> Challenges -> Strategies —> Projects -> Journal. This means that any project you're doing can be mapped all the way back up to the problem(s) you're trying to solve. This gives you transparency and explainability in everything you're doing so you don't end up busy for days/months/years without being able to remember why you're doing what you're doing.

## HISTORY

- I was born in Canada.  Both parents from Germany.  My native language is German.  I learned a little
English from babysitters and the neighbor girlfriend.
- Age 4 - moved to Germany while my father earned his second PhD in Physics.  The first was in Geology.
- Age 5 - moved tp France, where I went to elementary school.  French is my second language.
- I came to the US at age 10, Houston, TX, where I was bullied due being of German descent.  I had to learn English in a hurry.
- Everyone in high school had to take a second language.  I could not take German or French.  Spanish was the only choice I had.
- I moved to Knoxville, TN for my senior year.
- High school is where I met my 2 life-long friends, Gary and Hayes who are still my friends today
- 1975 - Became US Citizen
- 1976 - Got Amateur Radio Licence WA4OSH
- 1978 - Got FCC First Class License (now called Radio Telephone General)
- 1986 - BS Computer Science, University of New Mexico
- 1991 - Filed first patent for One Touch Dialing: 5491745 "Method and apparatus for a dual mode keypad permitting one-touch telephone number dialing" It was finally granted in 1996.
- 1999 - MS Computer Engineering, Florida Atlantic University  Thesis involved Systems Engineering and using the Z system specification language for the feature interactions problem.  Z was a poor language to specify feature interactions and did not help to elaborate feature interactions.
- 2002-2012 - T-Mobile part of the WiFi team.
- 2003 - Co-Author of F.Ohrtman and K.Roeder "Wi-Fi Handbook : Building 802.11b Wireless Networks"
- 1991-2015 15 patents in telecommunications
- 2012-2025 Contracting for Microsoft, AT&T, Amazon Kuiper, 
- 2024-2025 ARKA/Tethers Unlimited 

## PROBLEMS

P1: I've seen many automated test systems over the years, with some performing better than others. But why? Key issues include:
    Lack of version control, leading to random and unexplained glitches, often due to race conditions in concurrent processes.
    Unstable designs where two nearly identical testers, using the same software and instruments (same make and model), produced inconsistent results—leaving uncertainty about which was "correct."
    Agile development with little architectural planning, making maintenance increasingly difficult over time.
    Inability to adapt to new instruments with added features, limiting the systems' ability to perform tests beyond the original design.

P2: AI's are very good at creating code for portions of a system.  However, there are several challenges with developing code with an AI assistant:
    Code quality and accuray:  
        All AI generated code needs to be reviewed, tested and validated.
        Lack of human oversight
        Lack of testing framework
        The code generated by an AI may not meet coding guidelines.
        Code may be inaccurate, suboptimal in peformance, or may not compile or be generated lint-free.

    Security:


    Integration with legacy systems:



-P3: AI's don't have a lot of systems engineering experience yet.  They still have a difficulty in exploring various options that future-proof the initial code solution.  Early bad systems design decisions will be with the system until it gets refactored.  Sometime refactoring is too difficult.

P3: This captures a critical systems engineering issue. You might specify examples of "bad systems design decisions" (e.g., 

    Poor modularity:
    Lack of scalability:
